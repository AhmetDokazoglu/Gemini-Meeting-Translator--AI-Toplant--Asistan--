## ⚙️ Technologies and Architecture
| Layer | Technology Used | Function |
|-------|------------------|-----------|
| **Speech-to-Text (STT)** | OpenAI Whisper / SpeechRecognition | Converts speech input to text |
| **Machine Translation (MT)** | GPT API / Google Translate API | Translates text to the target language |
| **Text-to-Speech (TTS)** | gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech) | Generates natural-sounding audio output |
| **Interface / Dashboard** | Streamlit / PyQt | Interactive control panel for users |
| **Data Flow** | WebSocket / Async Queue | Synchronizes audio, text, and translations in real time |

## 🧩 System Workflow
1. The user speaks — the microphone captures the voice.  
2. The **Whisper** model converts speech to text.  
3. The text is translated via **GPT** or **Google Translate API**.  
4. The translated text appears on screen and is voiced through **gTTS**.  
5. Real-time subtitles ensure synchronized communication.
